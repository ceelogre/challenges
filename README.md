## Challenges collection
This is a repository for challenges that I have attempted mainly from [Codewards](https://codewars.com) and [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)  plus personal scripts that I use on a daily basis.  
The main languages are python and javascript but you'll occassionally come across some shell scripts.

### Found a bug or ways to spice it up?
Open an issue or create a pull request, I'll be more than happy to look at it :)
