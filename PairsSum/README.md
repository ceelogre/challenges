## Pairs Sum
Given a collection of numbers, find if there exist at least one pair whose sum equals the given number:

### Example

Input
``` 
collection C = [3,5,9,11,15,17]
number = 13
```

Output   
`False`

### Explanation
None of the pairs in the collection adds up to 13.

### Strategy
Two solutions are proposed, one with a runtime complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) and another with O(n)
