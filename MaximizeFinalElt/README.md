## Maximizing the final element
Given an array of integers, perform certain operations in order to satisfy some constraints. The constraints are as follows:
* The first array element must be 1
* For all other elements, the difference between adjacent integers must not be greater than 1. In other words, for `1 <= i <n, arr[i] - arr[i-1] <= 1`.  
To accomplish this, the following operations are available:
* Rearrange the elements in any way
* Reduce any element to any number that is at least 1

What is the maximum value that can be achieved for the final element of the array by following these operations and constraints?

Example:
`arr = [3, 1, 3, 4]`
1. Subtract 1 from the first element, making the array [2,1,3,4]
2. Rearrange the array into [1,2,3,4]
. The final element's value is 4, the maximum value that can be achieved. Therefore, the answer is 4.
