## Challenges collection
This is a repository for challenges that I have attempted mainly from codewars.com plus personal scripts that I use on a daily basis.  
The main language is python but you'll occassionally come across javascript and shell scripts.

### Found a bug?
Open an issue or create a pull request, I'll be more than happy to look at it :)
